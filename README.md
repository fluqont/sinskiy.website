# What's this?

This is my **personal website-portfolio** build with Astro, Tailwind and TypeScript. It includes pet projects, story, and details about me. You can also find links to social media profiles and contact me via email through this website.

# How can I access it?

It's hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Link is https://sinskiy.vercel.app/

# Can I clone it?

Of course!

1. Make sure you have Node.js >=18 and npm installed, and git name and email are set

```sh
# terminal
node -v
npm -v
git config --global -l
```

```sh
# sample result
v21.5.0
10.2.5
user.name=sinskiy_
user.email=sinskiy@proton.me
```

2. Clone the repo

```sh
# terminal
git clone https://github.com/sinskiy/sinskiy.github.io.git <your-custom-folder-name>
```

or using SSH

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sinskiy/sinskiy.github.io.git <your-custom-folder-name>
```

or using GitHub CLI

```sh
gh repo clone sinskiy/sinskiy.github.io <your-custom-folder-name>
```

3. Open cloned repo in your preferred editor

4. Explore! To learn more about technologies used, refer to their documentation:

- [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

You can just write basic CSS without Tailwind. You can also ditch TypeScript, if you change `"astro/tsconfigs/strictest"` to `"astro/tsconfigs/base"` in `tsconfig.json`
