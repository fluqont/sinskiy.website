Project's hover animation: Inspired by [skiff's website](https://skiff.com/) *(they have this animation where they talk about transparency and open source)*, copied from [Hyperplexed's codepen](https://codepen.io/Hyperplexed/pen/MWQeYLW)

'Hi, I'm Sinskiy, Web developer': Originally inspired by [first website from this video](https://inv.in.projectsegfau.lt/BZqzhmlTkAc?t=1), but now [link to his website](https://jacekjeznach.com/) doesn't seem to work *at least for me*

Button gradient: Inspired by [Monogram's website](https://monogram.io/)
