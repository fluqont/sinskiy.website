                A 16 years old from russia, who really likes reading dystopias
                and self-improvement books. It's hard for me to talk to
                strangers and I'm a bit awkward. Currently my two main goals are
                to be ready to work as a full stack/frontend developer and to
                improve my English speaking skills
              </p>

              <p>
                At age 9, I found countryballs and got into "politics". Of
                course I actually knew nothing about politics. But it still
                completely changed the direction of my life
              </p>
              <p>
                None of my previous acquaintances and friends were involved in
                politics, so I found new ones online. They were much older than
                me. In such an environment, it’s not hard to develop your own
                vision of life. My core value became freedom, and I started
                planning to move away from russia for obvious reasons
              </p>
              <p>
                When I switched my real-life friends to internet ones, I started
                spending a lot of my time on PC and phone, and besides politics
                I got into tech. I still hadn’t thought about becoming a
                developer, but I kept up with the latest tech news and knew a
                lot of advanced things about PCs
              </p>
              <p>
                At age 13, I created my first website as a school project
                because it was the first project I could think of, but I quickly
                forgot about web development. Then I read Atlas Shrugged
                (because I knew I was a libertarian), then started reading
                non-fiction books in general, and realized that I was in full
                control of my future. Now I want to leave russia more than ever
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem is that I’m from a small town, and my family
                definitelly can’t sponsor me in moving to another country (and
                "sponsoring" goes against my core values), so I need to earn
                money somehow. Not the easiest task for a minor
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides money, web development brings me joy. That’s why I spend
                a lot of my time creating websites and learning about exciting
                things!
