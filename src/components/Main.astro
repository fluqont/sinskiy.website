        A 16 years old from russia, who really likes reading dystopias and
        self-improvement books. It's hard for me to talk to strangers and I'm a
        bit awkward. Currently my two main goals are to be ready to work as a
        full stack/frontend developer and to improve my English speaking skills
      </p>

        <p>
          At age 9, I found countryballs and got into "politics". Of course I
          actually knew nothing about politics. But it still completely changed
          the direction of my life
        </p>
        <p>
          None of my previous acquaintances and friends were involved in
          politics, so I found new ones online. They were much older than me. In
          such an environment, it’s not hard to develop your own vision of life.
          My core value became freedom, and I started planning to move away from
          russia for obvious reasons
        </p>
        <p>
          When I switched my real-life friends to internet ones, I started
          spending a lot of my time on PC and phone, and besides politics I got
          into tech. I still hadn’t thought about becoming a developer, but I
          kept up with the latest tech news and knew a lot of advanced things
          about PCs
        </p>
        <p>
          At age 13, I created my first website as a school project because it
          was the first project I could think of, but I quickly forgot about web
          development. Then I read Atlas Shrugged (because I knew I was a
          libertarian), then started reading non-fiction books in general, and
          realized that I was in full control of my future. Now I want to leave
          russia more than ever
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is that I’m from a small town, and my family definitelly
          can’t sponsor me in moving to another country (and "sponsoring" goes
          against my core values), so I need to earn money somehow. Not the
          easiest task for a minor
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides money, web development brings me joy. That’s why I spend a lot
          of my time creating websites and learning about exciting things!
