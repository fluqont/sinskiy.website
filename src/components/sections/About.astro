      A 15 years old from russia, who really likes reading dystopias and
      self-improvement books. It's hard for me to talk to strangers and I'm a
      bit awkward. Currently my two main goals are to be ready to work as a full
      stack/frontend developer and to improve my English speaking skills
    </p>

      At age 9, I found countryballs and got into "politics". Of course I
      actually knew nothing about politics. But it still completely changed the
      direction of my life<br /><br />None of my previous acquaintances and
      friends were involved in politics, so I found new ones online. They were
      much older than me. In such an environment, it’s not hard to develop your
      own vision of life. My core value became freedom, and I started planning
      to move away from russia for obvious reasons<br /><br />When I switched my
      real-life friends to internet ones, I started spending a lot of my time on
      PC and phone, and besides politics I got into tech. I still hadn’t thought
      about becoming a developer, but I kept up with the latest tech news and
      knew a lot of advanced things about PCs<br /><br />At age 13, I created my
      first website as a school project because it was the first project I could
      think of, but I quickly forgot about web development. Then I read Atlas
      Shrugged (because I knew I was a libertarian), started reading non-fiction
      financial books, then started reading non-fiction books in general, and
      realized that I was in full control of my future. Now I want to leave
      russia more than ever<br /><br />The problem is that I’m from a small
      town, and my family definitelly can’t sponsor me in moving to another
      country (and "sponsoring" goes against my core values), so I need to earn
      money somehow. Not the easiest task for a minor. That’s why I spend a lot
      of my time creating websites and learning about exciting things!
