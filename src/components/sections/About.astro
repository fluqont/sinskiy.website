        A 15 years old from russia, who really likes reading dystopias and self-improvement books. It's hard for me to talk to strangers and I'm a bit awkward. Currently my two main goals are to be ready to work as a full stack/frontend developer and to improve my English speaking skills

        At age 9, I found countryballs and got into "politics". Of course I actually knew nothing about politics. But it still completely changed the direction of my life<br /><br />None of my previous acquaintances and friends were involved in politics, so I found new ones online. They were much older than me. In such an environment, it’s not hard to develop your own vision of life. My core value became freedom, and I started planning to move away from russia for obvious reasons<br /><br />When I switched my real-life friends to internet ones, I started spending a lot of my time on PC and phone, and besides politics I got into tech. I still hadn’t thought about becoming a developer, but I kept up with the latest tech news and knew a lot of advanced things about PCs<br /><br />At age 13, I created my first website as a school project because it was the first project I could think of, but I quickly forgot about web development. Then I read Atlas Shrugged (because I knew I was a libertarian), started reading non-fiction financial books, then started reading non-fiction books in general, and realized that I was in full control of my future. Now I want to leave russia more than ever<br /><br />The problem is that I’m from a small town, and my family definitelly can’t sponsor me in moving to another country (and "sponsoring" goes against my core values), so I need to earn money somehow. Not the easiest task for a minor. That’s why I spend a lot of my time creating websites and learning about exciting things!
