                    A 15 years old from russia, who really likes to read dystopias and self-improvement books. It's hard for me to talk to strangers and I'm a bit awkward. I use calendars to schedule my day to be more productive, and usually I code or try to speak English on Discord servers for language learning

                    Everything I have now, every interests and hobbies, are basically the outcome of just a few events in my life</br></br>At the age 9, I found countryballs and got into politics. Yeah, that sounds really funny - politics at 9 years old. And I agree that i didn’t actually know anything about politics. But it still completely changed the direction of my life</br></br>None of my previous acquaintances and friends were involved in politics, so I found new ones online. They were much older than me. In such an environment, it’s not hard to develop your own vision of life</br></br>My core value became freedom, in every sense. The thing is, in the place where I live now, that value is totally violated. I thought the same way when I was 9, I think absolutely the same way now. It’s even worse</br></br>When I switched my real life friends to internet ones, I started spending a lot of my time on PC and phone, and besides politics I got into tech. I still hadn’t thought about becoming a developer, but I kept up with the latest tech news and knew a lot of advanced things about PCs</br></br>I got a bit derailed at the age 12. I spent almost all of my time on the recently released Valorant. At 13, I created my first website as a school project, because it was the easiest project I could came up with, but I quickly forgot about web development. So I was still derailed</br></br>Everything has changed when I read Atlas Shrugged. This book, generally speaking, promotes my core values that I developed while I was interested in politics. Now I want to move out of russia more than ever. The problem is that I’m from a small town, and my family definitelly can’t sponsor me in moving to another country (and that goes against my core values). So I need to earn money somehow. Not the easiest task for a minor. That’s why I spend a lot of my time creating websites and learning exciting things!
